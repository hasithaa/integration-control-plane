// WORKFLOW COMMAND TUNNEL
// ============================================================================
// Executes workflow management operations WITHOUT any network path into the
// integration or its Temporal server: a command is queued here, delivered to the
// target runtime inside its next heartbeat response (a WORKFLOW_MGMT control
// command), executed in-process by the runtime's ICP bridge, and its result posted
// back on POST /icp/commandResult — correlated to the waiting frontend request by
// commandId. Latency is managed with a boost hint: while a user is actively working
// with workflow views, heartbeat responses carry a nextHeartbeatInSeconds cadence so the
// bridge polls faster than its regular interval. The cadence decays back to the regular
// interval as the runtime goes idle — a runtime is not kept at one heartbeat per second
// because someone once opened a workflow view.
//
// All state is in-memory, matching the ICP's single-instance architecture (like the
// runtime hash cache): a restart loses in-flight commands, whose callers time out
// and retry.

// How long a frontend request waits for the runtime's result. Must stay inside the
// frontend's 30s request timeout.

// The cadence asked of a boosted runtime, decaying back to its own interval as it goes
// idle. Each step is [seconds since the last workflow request, cadence to ask for while
// the elapsed time is below it]: one heartbeat per second while a user is likely still
// clicking, then 2s, 5s, and 10s. A flat window at 1s was the first design and cost too
// much: a runtime serving non-workflow traffic kept heartbeating every second long after
// the last workflow view was closed. Every workflow request resets the ramp, so an active
// session still gets the fastest cadence.
//
// The bridge ignores a hint that is not shorter than its own interval, so the last step is
// a no-op for a runtime already on a 10s interval and a mild speed-up for a slower one.
